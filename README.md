# sql-data-analytics-project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses SQL queries to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database.  
It is a continuation of the previous project: **sql-data-warehouse project**.

## Objectives
The scripts in this repo cover various analyses including:
- Database exploration
- Dimension and measure analysis
- Time-based trends
- Cumulative analytics
- Segmentation
- Reporting and more

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
sql-data-analytics-project/
├── datasets/     # Datasets used for the project (Gold View from Data Warehouse)
├── docs/         # [Planned] Documentation & architecture visuals (e.g., Tableau dashboards)
├── scripts/      # SQL scripts for EDA & Advanced Analytics
├── README.md     # Project overview & instructions
├── LICENSE       # License information
├── .gitignore    # Git ignore settings
└── requirements.txt # [Optional] Project dependencies (for future use)
```

### scripts/
Folder for SQL scripts that support:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Database Exploration  
  - Dimension & Measure Exploration  
  - Magnitude & Ranking Analysis
- **Advanced Analytics:**  
  - Change Over Time Analysis  
  - Cumulative & Performance Analysis  
  - Part-to-whole Analysis  
  - Segmentation  
  - Reporting (Customers, Products, etc.)

*(List of SQL script files and a short description for each can be added here if available)*

### datasets/
This folder is intended for sample datasets sourced from the Gold View in your data warehouse, used for analysis and testing.  
*(Add dataset file names and short descriptions once available)*

### docs/
Planned for documentation, data model diagrams, and Tableau dashboard screenshots/output (to be added).

## Tools and Technologies
- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
- [Planned] Tableau (for dashboard/visualization)

## How To Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/achelllu/sql-data-analytics-project/
   ```
2. Prepare your SQL Server environment and load the provided datasets if available.
3. Run SQL scripts in the `scripts/` folder as needed, following EDA-Analytics workflow.
4. (Optional) Visualize results in Tableau once dashboards are available.

## Output & Reporting
- [Planned] Output tables or reports from the analytics process will be added with samples or screenshots, especially after Tableau visualizations are completed.
